SAIFI Forecast

This app allows the user to enter an end month and current value of SAIFI (a relaibility
metric used in the electric utility industry), to predict a year-end SAIFI value.

SAIFI was developed by the IEEE, is industry standard, and is considered the prime measure of the
reliability of an electric utility. The ability to forecast SAIFI is critical. This application uses a 1,000
trial monte-carlosimulation based on actual past data to produce a forecast.
